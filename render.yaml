# Use this Blueprint to deploy coder on Render as a web
# service that uses a Postgres database to store
# workflow data.
#
# This Blueprint uses free instance types (specified by
# `plan`) for both the web service and the database. You
# can upgrade to paid instance types at any time to
# increase resources.

services:
  - type: web
    plan: free
    # This is the runtime for services that pull a prebuilt Docker image

    image:
      # Pulls the coder image tagged as latest from Docker Hub

    # The free instance type is limited to 1 GB of disk
